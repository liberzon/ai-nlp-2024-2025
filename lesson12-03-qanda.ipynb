    "# FAQ Matching with SentenceTransformer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the **SentenceTransformer** model to match user queries to frequently asked questions (FAQs) based on semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to:\n",
    "1. Encode a set of predefined FAQs and user queries using a SentenceTransformer model.\n",
    "2. Calculate the semantic similarity between queries and FAQs.\n",
    "3. Identify and return the most relevant FAQ and its corresponding answer for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. **Define FAQs and Queries**: A dictionary of FAQs and a list of user queries are provided.\n",
    "2. **Load the Model**: The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` pre-trained SentenceTransformer model is used for encoding.\n",
    "3. **Encode Text**: Both FAQs and queries are converted into vector embeddings.\n",
    "4. **Calculate Similarity**: Cosine similarity is computed to find the best matching FAQ for each query.\n",
    "5. **Display Results**: Matches are displayed in a structured and human-readable format using Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "- Install the `sentence-transformers` library:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install sentence-transformers"
